# Homework-Assignment-1
First homework assignment for Nodejs course, simple Hello World RESTful JSON api.  

The Port used is 2000. The route will be '/hello'. If you like, you can include
a name parameter in the query string, eg., '/hello?name=jim'

You will receive a JSON object {"welcome":"Hey there 'name'"}, if no name is
provided in the query string, then a default value will be used.
